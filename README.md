#  Implementation of Gradient-Descent-Alogrithm
In this project gardient descent algorithm is implemented from scratch. The data is simulated using a function and on this data gradient descent algorithm is applied to know how close are the co_efficients estimated by gradient descent compared to the actual co_efficients.
